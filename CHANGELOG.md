## [1.0.0-beta] 2024-01-04

### Added
- `parseLatex`. Developing this feature - parsing a LaTeX string for editing by MathKeyboardEngine - started after a [question thread](https://github.com/orgs/MathKeyboardEngine/discussions/1) was opened by [chengyi](https://github.com/WCY91).
- `insert` previously only accepted a single `TreeNode`, but it can now handle an `Array<TreeNode>` too.

## [0.1.0] 2023-02-28

- First release.
