## Swift examples

A minimal example can be found in "Examples/MyExecutable".

- It shows the dependency configuration in the "Examples/MyExecutable/Package.swift" file.
- It proofs that MathKeyboardEngine can be imported/used (in "MyExecutable.swift").

Open the root-folder of the repository in VS Code. Then use:
```
cd Examples/MyExecutable
swift run
```

For detailed implementation details, see the source code of one of the
[JavaScript examples](https://github.com/MathKeyboardEngine/MathKeyboardEngine/tree/main/examples).
